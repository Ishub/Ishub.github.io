      <title>Behind the scenes of a hit track</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2017, revenues from recorded music in the United States were estimated at a retail value of $8.7 billion, this market includes streaming services, live shows, record labels, artists, song writing and video streaming, which relies heavily on a single factor, the success of a song.Record Labels and artists release thousands of songs across various genres to get a few hit songs to get return on their investment. Considering the size of this market, there still lies ambiguity in what makes a song popular. Many factors go into deciding the success of a song such as artist popularity, holiday season, internet mood, trending topics on the web and while a lot of them can’t be controlled, there are many that can be. Music streaming apps such as Spotify, Apple Music pay the artists per stream, so it makes sense for music producers to want to maximize the number of streams their tracks get, so it becomes crucial to understand which factors significantly influence the popularity. The hypothesis to be tested was whether features such as audio properties, lyrics sentiment and artist popularity could impact the popularity of a song in-turn impacting the profits generated, and it was assumed that all marketing efforts by labels would yield equal results. The insights of the analysis can be used by music producers to get closer to increase profit margins in music production.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Craiglist Spam Ad Filter</title>
      <link>https://ishub.github.io/project/craiglist/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Millions of ads are posted every single day on Craigslist worldwide to a large extent anonymously. Millions of housing listings are posted in a month. It is difficult to check the listings for  the people looking for a new house. As per trends 6% of housing ads are spams. However, they can’t run all around the world policing and prosecuting people. This project intends to solve the house hunt problem by sending the updates of new listings as per the selection criteria of the user by filtering spam in housing listings.
Classified ad sites routinely process hundreds of thousands to millions of posted ads, and only a small percentage of those may be fraudulent. Online scammers often go through a great amount of effort to make their listings look legitimate. Examples include copying existing advertisements from other services, tunneling through local proxies, and even paying for extra services using stolen account information. Given below is on such listing that appears more like a work of art.
This project would try to provide value to both its client(Craigslist) &amp;amp; its users by solving some of the key issues. High volumes of rental scams damages the reputation of Craigslist &amp;amp; increases its user drop-off rates. Users have to spend hours finding legitimate ads and it takes a lot of time &amp;amp; resources to select a genuine listing from thousands of existing listings.
This project consists of applying data analysis and text analysis concepts &amp;amp; techniques towards the detection of online, classified fraud for housing ad listings and building an automated notification system to send new listings as per user’s search keywords. Traditional data mining is used to extract relevant attributes from an online classified advertisements database and machine learning algorithms are applied to discover patterns and relationships of fraudulent activity.&lt;/p&gt;
