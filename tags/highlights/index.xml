      <description>This was originally published as the Open Cosmics entry for the CERN Webfest. Did you know that there are high energy particles from far edges of the universe passing through your body as you read this? Ever wondered what actually goes on inside the detectors of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN? High energy cosmic beams hit the Earthâ€™s outer atmosphere, which in turn scatters these rays into a shower of particle decays.</description>

      <title>Sequence Analysis approach to improve product forecasts</title>

      <description>Worked with the leading auto part seller in the US, to improve sales forecast by implementing a sequence analysis approach with time-series data to improve the accuracy of the model.
This study investigates a novel application of sequence analysis to forecast new product demand, which is a modified version of the approach that has been used in the bioinformatics field for protein sequencing. For retailers, the problem of forecasting demand for products which have never existed previously is challenging.</description>
